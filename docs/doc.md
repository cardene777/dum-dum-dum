# Dum Dum Dum
DumDumDum is the first reference implementation built by TCG protocol. It's an onchain trading card game using the popular DumDum atomic asset collection.

TCG stands for Trading Card Game, and it's a 20 billion dollar RWA market. TCG protocol aims to bring such a huge industry by inventing a decentralized protocol whereby anyone can build their own trading card games using atomic assets and universal data licenses on AO.

## TCG Protocol
How Trading Card Game Works
Players own cards
Each card has parameters
Cards can be combined (e.g. a dumdum owns some weapons)
Game sessions take place with something at stake
Winners will be determined based upon card combinations and parameters
Winners obtain what is on stake at each session

So as a player, it becomes important to collect cards to let you win game sessions to earn winning prizes, and deal the cards with good tactics. Also each card could have art values too.

How TCGs fit with the AO protocols
AO and atomic assets are the perfect fit to build a decentralized trading card game protocol.

Cards are traded as atomic assets on universal content marketplace
Card parameters can be defined as transaction tags on Arweave and used in AO processes
AO processes can handle complex game rules and execute game sessions in a decentralized fashion
AO crons can auto-execute sessions and even AI players can own cards and join games
AO is highly performant and horizontally scalable unlike other blockchains
Card data are permanently stored onchain by Arweave unlike NFTs on other blockchains

In conclusion, there's no other decentralized protocols to bring in the 20 billion dollar TCG industry.
